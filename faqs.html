		<div class="faq-1 col">
			<p><strong>1) Do you provide insurance?</strong></p>
			<p><i>Unfortunatel due to the insurance industry, this type of insurance has become VERY expensive.  We ask that you check with your personal insurance provider and see if you are already covered, or if you can acquire coverage for the time of your rental. If not, we will require a security deposit of between $500 and $1000 which is fully refundable upon the return of the vehicle.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-2 col">
			<p><strong>2) How many people can go on your RZR?</strong></p>
			<p><i>We currently have a 4 seater Polaris RZR XP 1000 available for rent. We plan on adding more seats (to make it able to carry 4 adults and 2 children, or 2 adults and 4 children for a total of 6) in the future.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-3 col">
			<p><strong>3) Do you provide helmets or other riding gear?</strong></p>
			<p><i>We do not currently offer gear for our customers. Helmets are only required for travel on city roads. The vehicle has a roof, roll cage, and seat-belts. We also installed a full windshield recently, which makes the need for goggles less imperative. We do recommend that you bring sunglasses for when you are out on the trails to help with dust and sun.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-4 col">
			<p><strong>4) Who can drive your RZR?</strong></p>
			<p><i>Only the person(s) on the rental agreement can drive the RZR. It is illegal for anyone under 16 to operate the RZR on any city or county roads. We do NOT allow anyone under the age of 25 to rent or drive our RZR.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-5 col">
			<p><strong>5) How much do you charge per day?</strong></p>
			<p><i>Please see our “vehicles” page for the current rental rates and fees, along with the vehicles we currently offer.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-6 col">
			<p><strong>6) Do you offer multi-day discounts?</strong></p>
			<p><i>Yes, that is something we are willing to do. Please ask us when you call what our multi-day rates are.</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-7 col">
			<p><strong>7) Where can we ride the RZR?</strong></p>
			<p><i>Currently we do not allow our clients to take our RZR to the Sand Dunes. We recommend Tibble Fork Reservoir for a starting point into the mountain trails. You can also head down to Hobble Creek and take the Squaw Peak road trail. We are open to you taking it to any mountain trails that you are aware of, we just ask that you let us know where you will be heading. Feel free to check out all our latest adventures on our adventures page!</i></p>
